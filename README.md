# Breast_cancer_detection
Breast cancer is a widely occurring cancer in women worldwide and is related to high mortality. The objective of this review was to present several approaches to investigate the application of multiple algorithms based on machine learning (ML) approach and biosensors for early breast cancer detection. Automation is needed because biosensors and ML are needed to identify cancers based on microscopic images. ML aims to facilitate self-learning in computers. Rather than relying on explicit pre-programmed rules and models, it is based on identifying patterns in observed data and building models to predict outcomes.
